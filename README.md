Covention over configuration, enough said. 
Just in case, you don't have Maven, instructions here: http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html 

How to run tests?
=======================
Clone the project and run "mvn clean test" or "mvn clean verify". For your convenince, I have linked the project to Travis CI and the build status is displayed above.

GEDCOM parser is chosen as the project could be achieved with Java's rich XML parsing /File handling library, while the other projects might be achieved best with third-party libraries like Joda-Time
