How to run tests?
=======================
cd into the <a href="https://github.com/pkumar/aconex-coding-challenge/tree/master/gedcom-parser">gedcom-parser</a> directory and give "mvn clean test" or "mvn clean verify"


Choice of project
=======================
GEDCOM parser is chosen as the project could be achieved with Java's rich XML parsing /File handling library, while the other projects might be achieved best with third-party libraries like Joda-Time
